## 🚀 Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- OpenAI API Key
- Git

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd hr-hiring-agent
```

2. **Create Virtual Environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Configure Environment**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your OpenAI API key
```

5. **Run the Application**
```bash
# Start Streamlit UI
streamlit run src/ui/streamlit_app.py

# Or run directly (CLI mode)
python -m src.agent.hiring_agent
```

## 🎬 Demo Scenarios

The application handles various hiring scenarios:

1. **Technical Roles**: "Need to hire a senior backend engineer for our Series A startup"
2. **Marketing Roles**: "Looking for a growth marketing manager, budget is tight"
3. **Executive Roles**: "Time to hire a VP of Engineering, what's the process?"

## 🏆 Design Decisions & Architecture Rationale

### Why LangGraph?
- **Multi-step reasoning**: Perfect for complex hiring workflows
- **State management**: Natural conversation flow with memory
- **Tool integration**: Seamless orchestration of multiple tools

### Why SQLite over File-based Storage?
- **Scalability**: Better performance for concurrent users
- **Query flexibility**: Rich querying capabilities for analytics
- **Data integrity**: ACID properties for reliable state management

### Unique AI Innovation: Intelligent Questioning
Unlike basic chatbots that follow static scripts, our system:
- **Learns from context**: Previous answers inform future questions
- **Adapts to company stage**: Different strategies for startups vs. enterprises
- **Prioritizes intelligently**: Most important questions asked first
- **Recognizes patterns**: Similar successful hires inform recommendations

## 🔮 Future Improvements

With more time, I would enhance:

1. **Advanced ML Models**: Custom embeddings for better question relevance
2. **Integration APIs**: Real salary data from Glassdoor, Indeed
3. **Analytics Dashboard**: Hiring success rate tracking
4. **Multi-language Support**: Global hiring capabilities
5. **Candidate Matching**: Resume parsing and matching algorithms

## 📊 Performance & Scalability

- **Response Time**: < 2 seconds for most queries
- **Concurrent Users**: Supports multiple sessions via SQLite
- **Memory Management**: Efficient state compression
- **Cost Optimization**: Smart LLM usage with caching

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

```bash
# Run tests
