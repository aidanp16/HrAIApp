**Strong Hire Criteria Met:** Partially - Strong technical skills, some gaps
**Minimum Requirements Met:** Yes - All technical requirements met or exceeded
**Growth Potential:** High - Clear trajectory toward technical leadership

**Decision Recommendation:**
**HIRE** - Sarah is a strong technical candidate with proven ability to build scalable systems. While she lacks direct FinTech experience, her e-commerce background with payment systems is transferable. Her technical skills exceed requirements in core areas, and gaps (Kubernetes, domain knowledge) can be addressed through training and mentoring. Her experience with microservices migration and scale challenges makes her well-suited for a growth-stage company.

**Conditions for Success:**
- Provide 3-month FinTech domain immersion program
- Kubernetes certification and hands-on training
- Pair with experienced FinTech engineer for first 6 months
- Clear path to technical leadership role within 18 months

**Alternative Considerations:**
- Consider for Tech Lead track given leadership experience
- Salary should account for learning curve: suggest mid-range of band
- Start date could be flexible to allow for pre-boarding learning

**Confidence Level:** High - Technical assessment strongly positive, cultural fit indicators good, manageable gaps with clear development path."""
