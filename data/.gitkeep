# This file ensures the data/ directory is tracked by Git
# 
# The data/ directory will contain:
# - hiring_sessions.db (SQLite database for session persistence)
# - Temporary data files generated by the application
# - Analytics and usage tracking data
#
# Note: Actual database files are excluded via .gitignore
# but the directory structure is preserved for deployment
